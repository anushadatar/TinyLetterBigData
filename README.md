# Tinyletter, Big Data
Have a medium-sized email list? Want to look at (arbitrary) statistics, curate
content, and even send mass messages from the command line while using your
favorite text editor instead of Tinyletter's minimalistic interface? This is
a tool for you!

This project was created primarily as a personal resource and a quick Python
tooling and documentation practice exercise.
